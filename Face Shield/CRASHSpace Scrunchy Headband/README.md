# CRASHSpace Scrunchy Headband for Budmen Shield
Print!

This is a replacement for the elastic band on the Budmen design. This scrunchy snaps into place and tensions around the user's head to keep the mask firmly in place.

The shortage of elastic is causing us to reconsider how to attach the shields to workers heads. This design requires no elastic and is faster to assemble than with elastic.


Suggest printing in PETG for flexibility.

While printing, please set your seam to "Rear" or not on the path. Here is an example with what happens with another scrunchy type design:

The scrunchy printed with the seam not on the end looks like this:

This design is based off the design of [FaceShield.us](https://FaceShield.us). Thanks Peter Vikar!
