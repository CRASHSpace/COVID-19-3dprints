# CRASHSpace Scrunchy Headband for Budmen Shield
Print!

This is a replacement for the elastic band on the Budmen design. This scrunchy snaps into place and tensions around the user's head to keep the mask firmly in place.

The shortage of elastic is causing us to reconsider how to attach the shields to workers heads. This design requires no elastic and is faster to assemble than with elastic.
