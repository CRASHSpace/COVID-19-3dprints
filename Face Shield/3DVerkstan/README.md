![3DVerkstan Face shield](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/faceshield_3DVerkstanV5.jpg)

## Each mask consists of:
**1 x** [Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_letter_6-hole_v5.stl](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/3DVerkstan/Visor_Frame_NORTH_AMERICA_letter_6-hole_v5.stl)

**1 x** 0.005in thick poly sheet 3-hole punched to guides in [Lasercut-shield-NORTH-AMERICA-6-hole-letter-format.pdf](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/3DVerkstan/Lasercut-shield-NORTH-AMERICA-6-hole-letter-format.pdf)

*and*

**(optional) 1 x** Rubber band

**Print material:** PETG or PLA

**Suggested settings:** *Largest layer size option, up to 0.8mm DRAFT* with *~10% infill*.

### 3DVerkstan Instructions on how to do the punching:
1. Set your hole punch to the setting for a Letter sheet

2. Make a test punch in a piece of paper, then measure how far the holes are from each edge and make sure it is symmetric.

3. Print the Spacer piece and put it on top of your guide bar. This is what creates the hole offset needed.

4. Put the Letter (8.5"x11") and make one punch along one of the long sides, with the short edge resting on your spacer piece.

5. Flip the Letter sheet around its short axis, and make one punch on the opposite side, so you end up with 6 holes along the same edge.
