3d Print files for COVID 19

USC is looking for 6000 sets of the 3d printed mask. There are 3 parts. Print them in PETG or PLA. USC will sanitize them, then add the filters and straps. 


Based on La Factor√≠a 3D's [COVID Mask Thingiverse 3d print](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4225667).

Files are here on GitHub since Thingiverse seems to be having bandwidth issues.
