# COVID-19 3D prints and projects

COVID-19 is impacting medical professionals hard. If you are around L.A. and have a 3D printer or other fabrication tools, **we need your help.** CRASH Space has been working with USC Keck, Cedars-Sinai and others on the front line of this pandemic. You can read about our full efforts here: [https://blog.crashspace.org/covid/](https://blog.crashspace.org/covid/)

Let us know if you can help at covid@crashspace.org or on [this volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczant_0pGT0tIEJhOTPQsQpFoTAtQAkubEGK8ArdoSDPgAVQ/viewform).

### [(4/10) WE LAUNCHED OUR GOFUNDME!](https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/makers-united-against-covid-19)

*This repo will stay updated with the latest information and source files.*

### **(4/9) Drop off:** 6323 W 80th St, Los Angeles, CA 90045.
Times will be posted on [our calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=crashspacela@gmail.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles). USC Keck has enough for now to tide them over (Great work everyone!), so *no need to mail prints to them*.

## PRINT: Budmen Face Shields V5

**Cedars and Keck approved** for immediate use.

## PRINT OR LASER CUT: Ear Savers

Every recipient wants these. Mask bands not tugging on ears --> More comfortable --> Wear the mask longer (**safer**) --> Adjust the mask less (**safer**). If you have a smaller printer, making these is a great way to help.

## PRINT: Budmen Scrunchie strap

## LASER CUT (reference only): Cedars Budmen Shields
We are having these stamped in volume now, so no need to laser cut them for us. If you are making some of your own or for others, use clear sheets cut to this shape: [Cedars Budmen shield template](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V3/polysheet-templates/Cedars_Budmen_shield_v1.pdf). **NOTE:** Our template is different from the stock Budmen shield.

## HOLE PUNCH (reference only): Verkstan Shields
We have enough Verkstan shields to meet current demand. If you are making some of your own or for others, use clear 8.5" x 11" sheets, 3-hole punched to this shape: [Verkstan V5 3 Hole Punch](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/3DVerkstan/Verkstan-3HolePunch-CRASHSpaceMod.pdf)
