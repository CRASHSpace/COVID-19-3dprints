# COVID-19 3D prints and projects

COVID-19 is impacting medical professionals hard. If you are around L.A. and have a 3D printer or other fabrication tools, **we need your help.** CRASH Space has been working with USC Keck, Cedars-Sinai and others on the front line of this pandemic. You can read about our full efforts here: [https://blog.crashspace.org/covid/](https://blog.crashspace.org/covid/)

Let us know if you can help at covid@crashspace.org or on [this volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczant_0pGT0tIEJhOTPQsQpFoTAtQAkubEGK8ArdoSDPgAVQ/viewform).

**Delivery:** We have dropzones at 10526 Venice Blvd., Culver City, CA 90232, behind the building. Times will be posted on [our calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=crashspacela@gmail.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles).

**Delivered:** 1 evaluation unit for intubation testing

## DON'T PRINT: NIH Recommended Face Shield
Just informational. We haven't received requests for this **yet**. It adds material to the Budmen design to protect from above; however, it increases print time from 1 hour to ~4 hours.
