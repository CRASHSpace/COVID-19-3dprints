# COVID-19 3D prints

COVID-19 is impacting medical professionals hard. If you are around L.A. and have a 3D printer, **we need your help.** CRASH Space has been working with USC Keck Medicine and others on the front line of this pandemic. They need personal protective equipment, and have requested the following designs. Let us know if you can help at covid@crashspace.org or on [this volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczant_0pGT0tIEJhOTPQsQpFoTAtQAkubEGK8ArdoSDPgAVQ/viewform).

**Delivery:** We will have a dropzone at 10526 Venice Blvd., Culver City, CA 90232. Times will be posted on [our calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=crashspacela@gmail.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles). 

*Or* mail masks to:

```

*This repo will stay updated with the latest information and print files.*

## DON'T PRINT: NIH Recommended Face Shield
Just informational. We haven't received requests for this **yet**. It adds material to the Budmen design to protect from above; however, it increases print time from 1 hour to ~4 hours.
