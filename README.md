# COVID-19 3D prints and projects

COVID-19 is impacting medical professionals hard. If you are around L.A. and have a 3D printer or other fabrication tools, **we need your help.** CRASH Space has been working with USC Keck, Cedars-Sinai and others on the front line of this pandemic. You can read about our full efforts here: [https://covid.crashspace.org](https://covid.crashspace.org)

Let us know if you can help at covid@crashspace.org or on [this volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczant_0pGT0tIEJhOTPQsQpFoTAtQAkubEGK8ArdoSDPgAVQ/viewform).

## PRINT OR LASER CUT: Ear Savers
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Ear%20Savers](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Ear%20Savers)

![Ear Saver](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/EarSaver.jpg)

Every recipient wants these. Mask bands not tugging on ears --> More comfortable --> Wear the mask longer (**safer**) --> Adjust the mask less (**safer**). If you have a smaller printer, making these is a perfect way to help.

## PRINT: Budmen Scrunchie strap
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/CRASHSpace%20Scrunchy%20Headband](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/CRASHSpace%20Scrunchy%20Headband)

![Budmen Scrunchie Strap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/CS_scrunchy_blue_kevin.png)

These are more easily sanitized than an elastic strap, and are going to remote hospitals. PET or PETG only.

## PRINT: Face Masks
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Mask](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Mask)

**Large size only at the moment (5/13)**

## SEW: Face Masks
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Sewn%20Face%20Mask/COVID_SewnMask-Instructions_v9.pdf](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Sewn%20Face%20Mask/COVID_SewnMask-Instructions_v9.pdf)

## STANDBY: Budmen Face Shields V5 
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V5](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V5)

![Face shield](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/budmenfaceshieldv3_small.jpg)

Cedars and Keck approved for immediate use. While we clear some inventory, shift focus to [Ear Savers](#print-or-laser-cut-ear-savers).

*If you are making some for yourself or another group*, use clear sheets cut to this shape: [Cedars Budmen shield template](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V3/polysheet-templates/Cedars_Budmen_shield_v1.pdf). **NOTE:** Our template is different from the stock Budmen shield. Laser template here: [Cedars_Budmen_shield_v1cut.pdf](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V3/polysheet-templates/Cedars_Budmen_shield_v1cut.pdf)

## STANDBY: 3DVerkstan Face Shields V5
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/3DVerkstan](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/3DVerkstan)

![Face shield](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/faceshield_3DVerkstanV5_small.jpg)

We have enough Verkstan shields to meet current demand.

*If you are making some for yourself or another group*, use clear 8.5" x 11" sheets for the shield, 3-hole punched to this shape: [Verkstan V5 3 Hole Punch](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/3DVerkstan/Verkstan-3HolePunch-CRASHSpaceMod.pdf).

## DELIVERED: Laser Cut Aerosol Box
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Cedars%20Aerosol%20Box](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Cedars%20Aerosol%20Box)

![Cedars Aerosol Box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/aerosolbox-inField_small.jpg)

**Delivered:** 1 evaluation unit for intubation testing

## DON'T PRINT: SMP Face Shield
Just informational. **USC Keck evaluated**, and chose the Budmen design instead.
