# COVID-19 3D prints

Medical professionals are in need of PPE (Personal Protective Equipement). Crashspace has been in contact with USC Keck Medicine and others. They have asked for masks:


> We are accepting 3D printed parts. Keck Medical Center will finish attaching padding, filter, and elastic straps. We have two sizes of mask. Currently we are looking to produce a 2:1  M :L. If you are making these for other place or for personal use, we are using [Frost King 5/16" x1/4" D Profile Premium Rubber Self-Stick Weatherseal](https://smile.amazon.com/Frost-King-Self-Stick-Weatherseal-D-Section/dp/B000B4N3O0/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Frost+King+5%2F16%22+x1%2F4%22+D+Profile+Premium+Rubber+Self-Stick+Weatherseal&qid=1585453260&s=home-garden&sr=1-1). We are sealing around the outer edge with hot glue, but we are experimenting the Flex Seal. The filter is a Honeywell [HEPA filter model HRF201B](https://smile.amazon.com/Flintar-Replacement-Compatible-Honeywell-HRF201B/dp/B07SQ5NHJ7/ref=sr_1_5).
> 
> We are currently printing a variant of the pseudo N95 mask found on [https://lowellmakes.com/covid-19-response/](https://lowellmakes.com/covid-19-response/)
> 
> I’ve included our variants of their model. We are working on more thing including different sizes as well as a process to cast them using resin. I will update people as new models come out.
> 
> We are also working with people to produce face shields. Many of the designs out in the world right now are not wide enough for the liking of our Infection Prevention team. We are laser cutting 13 “ x 9.5” shields and 3D printing head bands. That design is also included (please note the attachment points on the model may need scaling for the thickness of the shield material).
> Any assistance would be most welcomed.

## Face Masks
USC is looking for 6000 sets of the 3d printed mask. [Download Files](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Mask). Print the 4 Face Mask STL files in PETG or PLA. There are 2 versions of the face mask, [Medium](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Mask/USCSW-Filtrated_Mask-v2M.stl) and [Large](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Mask/USCSW-Filtrated_Mask-v2L.stl) (just updated 3/28/2020), then a [cap](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Mask/covid_mask_cap.stl) and [grid.](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Mask/covid_mask_grid.stl) They want 2:1 M:L (more medium than large versions of the mask).  USC will sanitize them, then add the filters and straps. Suggested layer settings 0.3mm DRAFT with ~20% infill.

Did you print one? [Let us know](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczant_0pGT0tIEJhOTPQsQpFoTAtQAkubEGK8ArdoSDPgAVQ/viewform).

Based on La Factoría 3D's [COVID Mask Thingiverse 3d print](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4225667) but files are modified by USC Keck Medical.

Files are here on GitHub since Thingiverse seems to be having bandwidth issues.


## Face Shields
We are also looking for face shields. This model might update, print face masks before printing these models.
