## Our work

CRASH Space has been working with USC Keck, Cedars-Sinai and others on the front line of this pandemic. With these clinical partners, we have developed and refined designs for face shields, face masks and ear savers, and rallied the community to build them. For the latest information on our work: [https://covid.crashspace.org](https://covid.crashspace.org)

We launched [our GoFundMe](https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/makers-united-against-covid-19) on 4/10, and cannot thank our donors enough.

If you'd like to help build or assemble, let us know at covid@crashspace.org or on [this volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczant_0pGT0tIEJhOTPQsQpFoTAtQAkubEGK8ArdoSDPgAVQ/viewform).

## PRINT OR LASER CUT: Ear Savers
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Ear%20Savers](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Ear%20Savers)

![Ear Saver](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/EarSaver.jpg)

Every recipient wants these. Mask bands not tugging on ears == More comfortable. More comfortable == Wear the mask longer (**safer**) + Adjust the mask less (**safer**). If you have a smaller printer, making these is a perfect way to help.

## STANDBY: Budmen Scrunchie strap
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/CRASHSpace%20Scrunchy%20Headband](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/CRASHSpace%20Scrunchy%20Headband)

![Budmen Scrunchie Strap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/CS_scrunchy_blue_kevin.png)

These are more easily sanitized than an elastic strap, and are going to remote hospitals. PET or PETG only.

## SEW: Fabric Face Masks
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Sewn%20Face%20Mask/COVID_SewnMask-Instructions_v9.pdf](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Sewn%20Face%20Mask/COVID_SewnMask-Instructions_v9.pdf)

## DON'T PRINT: Budmen Face Shields V5 
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V5](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V5)

![Face shield](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/budmenfaceshieldv3_small.jpg)

Cedars and Keck approved for immediate use. Assembly instructions are [here](https://youtu.be/I1LvKaha7R0). As of 5/25, we are receiving injection molded visors to fill our outstanding requests.

*If you are making some for yourself or another group*, use clear sheets cut to this shape: [Cedars Budmen shield template](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V3/polysheet-templates/Cedars_Budmen_shield_v1.pdf). **NOTE:** Our template is different from the stock Budmen shield. Laser template here: [Cedars_Budmen_shield_v1cut.pdf](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V3/polysheet-templates/Cedars_Budmen_shield_v1cut.pdf)

## DON'T PRINT: 3DVerkstan Face Shields V5
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/3DVerkstan](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/3DVerkstan)

![Face shield](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/faceshield_3DVerkstanV5_small.jpg)

We have enough Verkstan shields to meet current demand, and have access to a donated stockpile.

*If you are making some for yourself or another group*, use clear 8.5" x 11" sheets for the shield, [3-hole punched to this shape](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/3DVerkstan/Verkstan-3HolePunch-CRASHSpaceMod.pdf). Instructions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz36MhT7p-c&feature=youtu.be).

**OR** for large numbers, make [this drill jig from Midsouth Makers](http://www.midsouthmakers.org/2020/04/memphis-fighting-covid-transparency-drilling-rig/#MemphisFightingCOVID)

Just informational. **USC Keck evaluated**, and chose the Budmen design instead.
