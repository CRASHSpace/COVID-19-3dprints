# COVID-19 3D prints and projects

COVID-19 is impacting medical professionals hard. If you are around L.A. and have a 3D printer or other fabrication tools, **we need your help.** CRASH Space has been working with USC Keck, Cedars-Sinai and others on the front line of this pandemic. You can read about our full efforts here: [https://blog.crashspace.org/covid/](https://blog.crashspace.org/covid/)

Let us know if you can help at covid@crashspace.org or on [this volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczant_0pGT0tIEJhOTPQsQpFoTAtQAkubEGK8ArdoSDPgAVQ/viewform).

### [(4/10) WE LAUNCHED OUR GOFUNDME!](https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/makers-united-against-covid-19)

*This repo will stay updated with the latest information and source files.*

### **(4/9) Delivery:** Dropzone moved to 6323 W 80th St, Los Angeles, CA 90045.
Times will be posted on [our calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=crashspacela@gmail.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles). USC Keck has enough supplies now to tide them over (Great work everyone!), so *no need to mail prints to them*.

## LASER CUT: Cedars Budmen Shields
If you have clear sheets 10" x 12" or larger, we are cutting them to this shape: [Cedars Budmen shield template](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V3/polysheet-templates/Cedars_Budmen_shield_v1.pdf)

**Note:** Our template is different from the stock Budmen shield.
