# COVID-19 3D prints and projects

COVID-19 is impacting medical professionals hard. If you are around L.A. and have a 3D printer or other fabrication tools, **we need your help.** CRASH Space has been working with USC Keck, Cedars-Sinai and others on the front line of this pandemic. You can read about our full efforts here: [https://blog.crashspace.org/covid/](https://blog.crashspace.org/covid/)

Let us know if you can help at covid@crashspace.org or on [this volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczant_0pGT0tIEJhOTPQsQpFoTAtQAkubEGK8ArdoSDPgAVQ/viewform).

### **Delivery (updated 4/9):** We moved dropzone to 6323 W 80th St, Los Angeles, CA 90045.
Times will be posted on [our calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=crashspacela@gmail.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles). USC Keck has enough supplies now to tide them over (Great work everyone!), so *no need to mail them prints*.

**If you make something**, please let us know here (We love pictures!): [https://airtable.com/shrZCoERKFkLPPHIm](https://airtable.com/shrZCoERKFkLPPHIm)

**If you'd like a donation receipt**, you can get one here: [https://airtable.com/shrjphZT0ER9aLhNy](https://airtable.com/shrjphZT0ER9aLhNy)

*This repo will stay updated with the latest information and source files.*
