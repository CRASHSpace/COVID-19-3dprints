## Our work

CRASH Space has been working with USC Keck, Cedars-Sinai and others on the front line of this pandemic. With these clinical partners, we have developed and refined designs for face shields, face masks and ear savers, and rallied the community to build them. For the latest information on our work: [https://covid.crashspace.org](https://covid.crashspace.org)

We launched [our GoFundMe](https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/makers-united-against-covid-19) on 4/10, and cannot thank our donors enough.

If you'd like to help build or assemble, let us know at covid@crashspace.org or on [this volunteer form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczant_0pGT0tIEJhOTPQsQpFoTAtQAkubEGK8ArdoSDPgAVQ/viewform).

### Drop off

## Print recommendation:

**As of late July**, demand for clinical face shields has tapered off as supply chains have caught up. We will announce periodic sprint runs as individual requests come in, and maintain this page for others wanting to produce PPE designs we've validated. As the situation evolves, we too will adapt.

## Sprint Run 8/14 - 8/26: 3DVerkstan Face Shields, V5
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/3DVerkstan](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/3DVerkstan)

![Face shield](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/faceshield_3DVerkstanV5_small.jpg)

LA EOC requested 2000 non-clinical face shields. We can handle making the shields, but need visors printed.

*If you are making some for yourself or another group and need the shield information*: This version uses clear 8.5" x 11" sheets, [3-hole punched to this shape](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/3DVerkstan/Verkstan-3HolePunch-CRASHSpaceMod.pdf). Instructions [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz36MhT7p-c&feature=youtu.be). **OR** for large numbers, make [this drill jig from Midsouth Makers](http://www.midsouthmakers.org/2020/04/memphis-fighting-covid-transparency-drilling-rig/#MemphisFightingCOVID)

## Budmen Face Shields V5 
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V5](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V5)

![Face shield](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/budmenfaceshieldv3_small.jpg)

Cedars and Keck approved for immediate use. Assembly instructions are [here](https://youtu.be/I1LvKaha7R0). As of 5/25, we are receiving injection molded visors to fill our outstanding requests.

**NOTE:** Our template is different from the stock Budmen shield: [Modified Cedars Budmen shield template](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V3/polysheet-templates/Cedars_Budmen_shield_v1.pdf). Laser template is here: [Cedars_Budmen_shield_v1cut.pdf](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V3/polysheet-templates/Cedars_Budmen_shield_v1cut.pdf)

## Budmen Scrunchie strap

![Budmen Scrunchie Strap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/CS_scrunchy_blue_kevin.png)

Made in response to elastic shortages we faced one month in, these are also more easily sanitized than elastic. Very useful for remote hospitals. PET or PETG only.

## Ear Savers
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Ear%20Savers](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Ear%20Savers)

![Ear Saver](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/EarSaver.jpg)

Mask bands not tugging on ears == More comfortable. More comfortable == Wear the mask longer (**safer**) + Adjust the mask less (**safer**). If you have a smaller printer, making these is a perfect way to help.

## Fabric Face Masks

As of 5/25, we have filled our outstanding requests. We can collect any you have already printed.

**Delivered:** 1 evaluation unit for intubation testing

## SMP Face Shield
Just informational. **USC Keck evaluated**, and chose the Budmen design instead.
