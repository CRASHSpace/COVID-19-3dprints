## PRINT OR LASER CUT: Ear Savers
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Ear%20Savers](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Ear%20Savers)

![Ear Saver](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/EarSaver.jpg)

Every recipient wants these. Mask bands not tugging on ears --> More comfortable --> Wear the mask longer (**safer**) --> Adjust the mask less (**safer**). If you have a smaller printer, making these is a perfect way to help.

## PRINT: Budmen Scrunchie strap
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/CRASHSpace%20Scrunchy%20Headband](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/CRASHSpace%20Scrunchy%20Headband)

![Budmen Scrunchie Strap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/CS_scrunchy_blue_kevin.png)

These are more easily sanitized than an elastic strap, and are going to remote hospitals. PET or PETG only.

## SEW: Fabric Face Masks
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Sewn%20Face%20Mask/COVID_SewnMask-Instructions_v9.pdf](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Sewn%20Face%20Mask/COVID_SewnMask-Instructions_v9.pdf)

## DON'T PRINT: Budmen Face Shields V5 
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V5](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V5)

![Face shield](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/budmenfaceshieldv3_small.jpg)

Cedars and Keck approved for immediate use. As of 5/25, we are receiving injection molded visors to fill our outstanding requests.

*If you are making some for yourself or another group*, use clear sheets cut to this shape: [Cedars Budmen shield template](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V3/polysheet-templates/Cedars_Budmen_shield_v1.pdf). **NOTE:** Our template is different from the stock Budmen shield. Laser template here: [Cedars_Budmen_shield_v1cut.pdf](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/Budmen%20Face%20Shield/V3/polysheet-templates/Cedars_Budmen_shield_v1cut.pdf)

## DON'T PRINT: 3DVerkstan Face Shields V5
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/3DVerkstan](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/3DVerkstan)

![Face shield](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/faceshield_3DVerkstanV5_small.jpg)

We have enough Verkstan shields to meet current demand, and have access to a donated stockpile.

*If you are making some for yourself or another group*, use clear 8.5" x 11" sheets for the shield, 3-hole punched to this shape: [Verkstan V5 3 Hole Punch](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Shield/3DVerkstan/Verkstan-3HolePunch-CRASHSpaceMod.pdf).

## DON'T PRINT: Face Masks
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Mask](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Mask)

![Face Mask Assembly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/facemask_USCV2-render_small.png)

As of 5/25, we have filled our outstanding requests. We can collect any you have already printed.

## DELIVERED: Laser Cut Aerosol Box
[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Cedars%20Aerosol%20Box](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Cedars%20Aerosol%20Box)

![Cedars Aerosol Box](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/master/images/aerosolbox-inField_small.jpg)

**Delivered:** 1 evaluation unit for intubation testing

## DON'T PRINT: SMP Face Shield
Just informational. **USC Keck evaluated**, and chose the Budmen design instead.

[https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/SMP%20Face%20Shield](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Shield/SMP%20Face%20Shield)
