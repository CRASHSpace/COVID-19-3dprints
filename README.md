# COVID-19 3D prints

## Face Masks
USC is looking for 6000 sets of the 3d printed mask. [Download Files](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/tree/master/Face%20Mask). Print the 4 Face Mask STL files in PETG or PLA. There are 2 versions of the face mask, [Medium](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Mask/USCSW-Filtrated_Mask-v2M.stl) and [Large](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Mask/USCSW-Filtrated_Mask-v2L.stl) (just updated 3/28/2020), then a [cap](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Mask/covid_mask_cap.stl) and [grid](https://github.com/CRASHSpace/COVID-19-3dprints/raw/master/Face%20Mask/covid_mask_grid.stl) . USC will sanitize them, then add the filters and straps. 

Did you print one? [Let us know](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczant_0pGT0tIEJhOTPQsQpFoTAtQAkubEGK8ArdoSDPgAVQ/viewform).

Based on La Factor√≠a 3D's [COVID Mask Thingiverse 3d print](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4225667).

Files are here on GitHub since Thingiverse seems to be having bandwidth issues.


## Face Shields
We are also looking for face shields. This model might update, print face masks before printing these models.
