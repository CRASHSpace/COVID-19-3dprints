**1 x** covid_mask_grid.stl

#### Need:
**2 Medium** masks for every **1 Large** mask

Print material: PETG or PLA

Suggested layer settings: 0.3mm DRAFT with ~20% infill.

### 3/29 Update:
> Heads up. I received a batch with some print issues. Some surface imperfections is fine, but issues with the filter interface is bad. Please check to see if those print areas are free of issues before dropping off. That would be awesome.

## Information:
> We are accepting 3D printed parts. Keck Medical Center will finish attaching padding, filter, and elastic straps. We have two sizes of mask. Currently we are looking to produce a 2:1  M :L. If you are making these for other place or for personal use, we are using [Frost King 5/16" x1/4" D Profile Premium Rubber Self-Stick Weatherseal](https://smile.amazon.com/Frost-King-Self-Stick-Weatherseal-D-Section/dp/B000B4N3O0/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Frost+King+5%2F16%22+x1%2F4%22+D+Profile+Premium+Rubber+Self-Stick+Weatherseal&qid=1585453260&s=home-garden&sr=1-1). We are sealing around the outer edge with hot glue, but we are experimenting the Flex Seal. The filter is a Honeywell [HEPA filter model HRF201B](https://smile.amazon.com/Flintar-Replacement-Compatible-Honeywell-HRF201B/dp/B07SQ5NHJ7/ref=sr_1_5).
> 
> We are currently printing a variant of the pseudo N95 mask found on [https://lowellmakes.com/covid-19-response/](https://lowellmakes.com/covid-19-response/)
> 
> I’ve included our variants of their model. We are working on more thing including different sizes as well as a process to cast them using resin. I will update people as new models come out.
> 
> We are also working with people to produce face shields. Many of the designs out in the world right now are not wide enough for the liking of our Infection Prevention team. We are laser cutting 13 “ x 9.5” shields and 3D printing head bands. That design is also included (please note the attachment points on the model may need scaling for the thickness of the shield material).
> Any assistance would be most welcomed.
