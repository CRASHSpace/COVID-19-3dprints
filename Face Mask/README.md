USCSW_gasket_x5S.stl, USCSW_gasket_x5M.stl and USCSW_gasket_x5L.stl are for molding tests. DON'T PRINT

**Print material:** PETG or PLA

**Suggested settings:** *Largest layer size option, up to 0.6mm DRAFT* with *~10% infill*.

**Print Ratio:** Large masks only at the moment (5/13)

## Parts you need to assemble:
DO NOT assemble if delivering to USC Keck. This is for assembling one for yourself.

* [Frost King 5/16" x1/4" D Profile Premium Rubber Self-Stick Weatherseal](https://smile.amazon.com/Frost-King-Self-Stick-Weatherseal-D-Section/dp/B000B4N3O0/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Frost+King+5%2F16%22+x1%2F4%22+D+Profile+Premium+Rubber+Self-Stick+Weatherseal&qid=1585453260&s=home-garden&sr=1-1). 
* [Honeywell HEPA filter model HRF201B](https://smile.amazon.com/Flintar-Replacement-Compatible-Honeywell-HRF201B/dp/B07SQ5NHJ7/ref=sr_1_5)

## Did you print one?
They would also like to know the following:

Name/Company (opt.)

Date

Qty

Printer type

Print materials

This can be recorded [here](https://airtable.com/shrZCoERKFkLPPHIm), or written and submitted with prints.

### 3/29 Update:
> Heads up. I received a batch with some print issues. Some surface imperfections is fine, but issues with the filter interface is bad. Please check to see if those print areas are free of issues before dropping off. That would be awesome.

### Information:
> We are accepting 3D printed parts. Keck Medical Center will finish attaching padding, filter, and elastic straps. We have two sizes of mask. Currently we are looking to produce a 2:1  M:L. If you are making these for other place or for personal use, we are using [Frost King 5/16" x1/4" D Profile Premium Rubber Self-Stick Weatherseal](https://smile.amazon.com/Frost-King-Self-Stick-Weatherseal-D-Section/dp/B000B4N3O0/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Frost+King+5%2F16%22+x1%2F4%22+D+Profile+Premium+Rubber+Self-Stick+Weatherseal&qid=1585453260&s=home-garden&sr=1-1). We are sealing around the outer edge with hot glue, but we are experimenting the Flex Seal. The filter is a Honeywell [HEPA filter model HRF201B](https://smile.amazon.com/Flintar-Replacement-Compatible-Honeywell-HRF201B/dp/B07SQ5NHJ7/ref=sr_1_5).
> 
> We are currently printing a variant of the pseudo N95 mask found on [https://lowellmakes.com/covid-19-response/](https://lowellmakes.com/covid-19-response/)
> 
> I’ve included our variants of their model. We are working on more thing including different sizes as well as a process to cast them using resin. I will update people as new models come out.
> 
> We are also working with people to produce face shields. Many of the designs out in the world right now are not wide enough for the liking of our Infection Prevention team. We are laser cutting 13 “ x 9.5” shields and 3D printing head bands. That design is also included (please note the attachment points on the model may need scaling for the thickness of the shield material).
> Any assistance would be most welcomed.
